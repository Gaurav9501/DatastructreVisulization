			<p>A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order
				in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First
				Out (FIFO). A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for
				a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. The
				difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we
				remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the
				item the least recently added</p>
